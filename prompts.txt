Consider a student following your curriculum to learn Python. Please make a list of subtopics you would teach for "Dictionaries". You can list as many or as few items as required for the topic as required. For each of these topics, consider if it would be better suited for either a multiple choice question or a coding challenge. Remember that introductory syntax topics are usually more suited for multiple choice questions. Return your list as a json object where the keys are these topics, and the values are either "multiple-choice" or "coding-challenge" representing what type of question best suits the topic.
